# Outreach Extensibility SDK

Welcome to the Outreach Extensibility SDK, a powerful library designed to streamline the development of client extensions for [Outreach](https://outreach.io). If you are looking to enhance your Outreach experience and create custom extensions, this SDK is the ideal starting point. For comprehensive documentation and resources, please visit the [Outreach Developer Portal](https://developers.outreach.io).

## Getting Started

To incorporate the Outreach Extensibility SDK into your project, please refer to our detailed guide [here](https://developers.outreach.io/client-extensions/javascript-sdk/).

## Usage Examples

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have Node.js installed and your preferred package manager (Yarn or npm) available.

### Installation and Setup

To set up an example project, navigate to the 'examples' folder:

```sh
cd ./examples/my-first-outreach-app
```

Next, install the necessary Node.js modules using Yarn or npm:

```sh
yarn
# or
npm install
```

Finally, run the project with the following command:

```sh
yarn start
# or
npm start
```

### Local development

Given that the Outreach context is exclusive to the Outreach extension, it's imperative to establish a secure tunnel for local development.
Please check out our guide for [Local Development](https://developers.outreach.io/client-extensions/local-development/).
