Every Outreach application can request one or more contextual values describing the current Outreach user.

The properties are grouped into four groups: account, opportunity, prospect, and user.

_In case you would like to have additional contextual properties, please contact us on **cxt-sdk@outreach.io.**_

add to manifest one or more account properties.

Our end goal is to provide contextual access to any of the properties available through the
[Outreach API](https://api.outreach.io/api/v2/docs#account), but at the moment we support in
[SDK](../src/context/keys/AccountContextKeys.ts) next properties:

# External contextual information

Every Outreach user can have one or more plugins installed and connect Outreach with Salesforce, Dynamics, and other
providers of prospect, account, and opportunity data.

Once a plugin is installed (Settings/Plugins) and synchronizing data with the external data source prospect page will
show a new section with external prospect information.

We have created SDK support for a set of dedicated manifest keys to enable application creators to receive this external
prospect information and use it to link data in their own dataset with the outreach account through the same shared
external ID used in both systems.

There are six context keys available for application creators to access current Outreach user info:

- **acc.extid** retrieving external id of the Outreach account id in the external system.
- **acc.extprvd** retrieving account provider name (Salesforce, Dynamics, etc.)

- **pro.extid** retrieving external id of the Outreach prospect id in the external system.
- **pro.extprvd** retrieving prospect provider name (Salesforce, Dynamics, etc.)

- **opp.extid** retrieving external id of the Outreach opportunity id in the external system.
- **opp.extprvd** retrieving external opportunity info
