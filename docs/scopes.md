# Outreach API scopes

If an application needs access to Outreach API it needs to define one or more of
[API scopes](https://api.outreach.io/api/v2/docs#authorization) it needs. The Outreach user will then need to consent
with the granting impersonalized API access with requested scopes.

From [Outreach API](https://api.outreach.io/api/v2/docs#authorization) documentation

> Authorization scopes let you specify exactly what type and level of access your application requires. Your OAuth
> application’s scopes describe the possible set of values that may be requested, but the specific scopes requested
> during the authentication process are what will be applied to the resulting access token and used to restrict and
> permit application access.
>
> Scopes are strings containing two parts: the first part is a pluralized resource name (e.g. prospects); the second
> part is a token — read, write, delete or all — that describes the level of access permitted. For example, the scopes
> prospects.read and prospects.all would both grant access to read prospects, while only the latter would permit write
> and delete access. Scopes are not additive; the prospects.write scope does not grant read access.
